## Overview

A FEM-dev challenge that requires use of media queries in order to change an image from vertical to horizontal. One of my favorite and smoothest projects yet. I believe this is my best code to date but I have a lot of room for improvement. Time to see where it goes from here.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

I started with finishing up to html prompt given to me. I then went into getting the layout of my design set where I wanted it. After that I worked on the fonts and making my product look good. I finished but adding my media queries to swap my images and cleaned up my code and design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I am happy with how I am using my var(). Although I dont use them much I find it necessary to continue my learing process with them involved. Also learning how to swap out images and tweaking the design to fit smaller screens was a fun development.

```html
<button class="cart" type="button">
            <img width="35" src="images/icon-cart.svg" alt="shopping cart logo">
            <strong>Add to Cart</strong> 
          </button>
```
```css
color: var(--main-text-color);
    font-family: var(--main-font-family);
    font-size: .85rem;
    font-weight: var(--main-fw-500);
    letter-spacing: .2rem;
```

### Continued development

I still need to work on my format. I struggle with getting my product to line up properly. Once I get that down, I should be ready for some JS.
